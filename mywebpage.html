    <h1>Information about myself</h1>
    Im just an ordinary Kazakh teenager, who is interested in programming. And to be honest, the reason that im interested in this is about earning a lots of money. I want to work in some buisness companies as an IT programmer to make a lot of money for myself and for my family. That's it, there is nothing about a dream speciality or personal interest. Its just about working in a perspective work, that will be needed in the future. Because i have a bigger dream, and my dream requires a lot of money to be realized. Thats the main reason why im here and why im studying programming. 
<h2>My interestings:</h2>
<p>Well, nowdays, i'm interested in the things, that can seem to be boring for a lot of people. Because this things are not so popular and cool in this days. But for me, its not so nessecary to be popular or cool to have and engage my interest. And that kind of things are: <strong>philosophy, politics, mythology, psychology, economics</strong>, and also <strong>science</strong> and <strong>programming</strong>, of course. And therefore, there is a several list of books, that i'd love to read. </p>
